# What is it?

Enhanced Backend is an extension developed by 3m5. to make the work of editors in the TYPO3 backend more pleasant.
There are features that visually change the backend and also functionalities that are added to the backend.

Created by:[3m5.de - The TYPO3 Agency](https://www.3m5.de/digitalagentur/typo3-agentur)

## Presets

The primary goal of the extension is individuality, which is why each feature can be enabled or disabled individually.
If this is too complex for you, you can choose between 3 predefined sets:

1. **No changes**: Original TYPO3 backend (default setting)
2. **Vanilla‚Å∫**: This preset is based on the corporate design of TYPO3. Functionalities are not changed or added. There are only minor UI optimizations.
3. **Modern**: This preset activates all available functions and optimizations of the "Enhanced Backend" extension. The UI/UX is based on current developments and there is a content tree that enables quick navigation across all content on a page.
4. In addition to these sets, there is also the "User-defined" setting: This preset adopts the last selected settings (from the other presets) and allows individual deactivation/activation of individual functions and optimizations.
