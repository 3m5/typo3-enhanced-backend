# TYPO3 Extension `enhanced backend`

The Enhanced Backend Extension improves the user experience (UX) in the TYPO3
backend, provides customization options for editors and improves the look and
feel of TYPO3 so that it represents a modern and intuitive eCMS.

It includes these features:

* Editors can apply presets or custom enhancements to the backend in their user settings
* Two different presets from which editors can choose individually:
  * Vanilla+: Small and useful improvements that are strongly based on the TYPO3 corporate design
  * Modern: A modern look with state-of-the-art customizations, such as a fresh icon set, optimized spacing and improved color concept
* In custom mode editors can choose from all available improvements individually
* Editors can switch back to the standard backend at any time
